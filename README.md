# Space Website Ass.- I learned a lot of new css skills and tools during this assignment. I find this one to be the most aesthetically pleasing as well.
# One Page Website- This was one of the first assignments I had full creative freedom with what to do in my css. I really like the idea behind this one but it could use more css.
